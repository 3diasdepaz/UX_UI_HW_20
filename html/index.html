    <h1>Our Client</h1>
    <p>Donate Cars 4 Cancer is a non-profit organization committed to funding the fight against cancer for children and their families. They contribute to this cause by collecting and appraising donated vehicles, endowing partner organizations who directly support children and families impacted by cancer. 
    </p>

 <section>
    <h1>Empathize</h1>
    <p>As researchers, we wanted to analyze what motivates users to donate and how they find information relevant to making a donation. 

        Through generative interviews, we asked : 
        
        What specifically influences and/or motivates people to donate?
        How do interested donors experience the donation process?
        
        Our participants were individuals who value altruism, are interested in donating, and enjoy helping others.  
    </p>

<section>
    <h1>Define</h1>
    <p>Our web page was designed to connect caring individuals with a vehicle to donate to quality charities that are active against kids cancer. We have observed that our site is not meeting credibility and legitimacy factor with our audience. How might we improve the reliability of this website through  communication and consistent UI design so users trust the organization and donate? 
    </p>

<img src="images/IterationProtoCopy.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

<section>
    <h1>Ideate</h1>
    <p>Through the iteration process, we discovered how important clarity; simple, helpful interactions; and the impact of human stories are to our client’s users. Our iteration approach centered around these values and creating consistent UI patterns to garner trust and credibility.  
    </p>

<img src="images/DesktopProto.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

<section>
    <h1>Prototype</h1>
    <p>And here you find prototype that solved our initial problem. This prototype presents primary navigation headers, keywords, donate button for clarity; interactions located in the “Wheel of Impact” section for delightful, easy mobility; and a highly visible mission statement and multimedia impact stories that capture the real people on the other side of this webpage.     </p>

<img src="images/KeyInsight.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

<section>
    <h1>Remember</h1>
    <p>We gained so much long-term learning from the process. Some of the key insights gained are:

        Cues from UI determine trust.  
        Ease may suffice expectation.
        Clarity (of UI patterns) is key.
        Grounding elements matters.
